# Titanic Survival Analysis & Prediction
This repository contains the Titanic Dataset and its analysis notebook (titanic-dataset.ipynb), which explores one of the most famous datasets in data science — predicting survival outcomes of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic.
🧭 Project Overview

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Titanic Dataset, one of the most iconic datasets in data science.
Using the notebook titanic-dataset.ipynb, we explore, clean, and analyze the passenger data to uncover the key factors that influenced survival during the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic.

The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model building for survival prediction.

📈 Key Insights

Female and higher-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates.

Younger passengers and those with smaller family sizes were more likely to survive.

Feature engineering on categorical and numerical data improves model accuracy.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add deep learning models for survival prediction.

Create an interactive dashboard (using Streamlit or Plotly Dash).

Optimize model using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
